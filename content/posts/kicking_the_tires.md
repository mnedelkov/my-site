I am currently trying to get this site up and running. I have no experience using HUGO to build websites making this quite a challenge.

The current plan is to get a git repository set up. I'm hoping I can have the server update the site itself when it detects a push to the site's repository. Not sure how to do this yet.

On the positive side, I have figured out a bunch about how theming and configuring HUGO sites works. The terminal theming is *definitely* cool and not tacky at all. I am also gaining a decent familiarity with using markdown to create webpages.

Looks like this post is working great though! Just need to get the 
"about" page set up and I basically have a fully functional, if plain, website.
